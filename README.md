# Errors-and-Exceptions-Handling-Python⚠️

<br>
🌊 Also have a look at the [Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) in Python.


## Applications :

📍 Errors handling helps in detecting the possible errors in the code.<br>
📍 Exception handling ensures that the flow of the program doesn't break when an exception occurs.
  <br>
 💡 For example, if a program has bunch of statements and an exception occurs mid way after executing certain statements, then the statements after the exception will not execute and the program will terminate abruptly.
